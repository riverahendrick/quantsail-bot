# (Deprecated) Prompt file retained for compatibility — DO NOT RUN

This file existed in v4. For v7, use:
- Canonical: `docs/08_PROMPTS/08_BREAKERS_AND_NEWS_PAUSE.md`
- Full mapping and execution order: `docs/08_PROMPTS/INDEX.md`
- Legacy v4 content is preserved here: `docs/08_PROMPTS//09_NEWS_FILTER.md`

If you need something from the legacy instructions, copy the relevant details into the canonical prompt (and update docs/CHANGELOG.md).
